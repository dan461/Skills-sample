# Skills-sample

A partial duplicate of a repo for a Flutter project. The app is a tool for tracking and managing music practice sessions and activities. The original project is created using a Clean architecture approach, with Data, Domain and Presentation layers, which are located in the lib/features/skills directory. The code is being developed using TDD (mostly). Packages being used include sqlflite, flutter_bloc, and get_it. This repo is not complete and the project will not compile and run if cloned.
